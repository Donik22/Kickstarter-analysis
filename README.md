# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of project
This Project Helps us Analyse and Visualize campaign outcomes based on dates and their funding goals. This project will be run using Microsoft Excel and built-in Analysis tools that will help us perform lengthy calculations in a shorter time. To make a better decision Some charts and tables might be filtered to simulate Louises's situation. We reffered to This [Excel Data set](https://github.com/Donik22/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/StarterBook.xlsx) To drow our analysis

### Purpose
By The end of this project I want to help Louise make the best decistion possible on how much she should aim for to have a successful campaign and when she should start. I also want to explain how we got into our conclusions and the way we approached the data. Different Charts will be demonstrated through out the presentation to support the conclusion.

##  Analysis and Challenges
knowing there where a lot of categories and sub-categories we had to narrow it down to theater to increase the accuracy of our conclusion. We also Grouped the data by month and to furthur visualize the trends a `line with marker` chart was utilizied from excel. The next Challenge was to determine whether the Goal amount has any Corrolation with the success of a campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
This Analysis Was done to determine which month of the year was best to launch a campaign and specifically for a play type. As you can see in the chart Campaigns tend to have more success when done Between May and july. The month of October saw a spike in Failed Campaigns Between Octomber and December is the worst time to Start a Campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In This Analysis we calculated the Percentage of Success, failiuer and cancelation of a campaign and compared those number to goal groups. It shows that the campaign is more likely to be successful if the goal was set to be less than 3000.

### Challenges and difficulties encountered
The Data was very Broad and we had to narrow it to fit the clients criteria. Given That the data was spread out we cant claim that it is accurate to a specific Country or category With the exception of `Analysis of Outcome Based on Launch date`. Data also showed some outliers but was kept for data integrity.

## Results

- On `Outcomes Based On lauch Date` We Concluded That The Month of may is the best month to launch a Campaign and the month of october is the worst.
- On `Outcomes Based On Goals` We concluded that Asking for more than 3000 Will Decreases You're Chances of a Successful Campaign.
- The Limitation on this data set is a small data size relative To Our criteria.
- Other Chart that can be used to determine a realistic ask for a goal is The `Box and Whiskers` Which if narrowed down to Great Britin and Theater as a category will show the same Conclusion.
