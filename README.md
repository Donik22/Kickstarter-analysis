# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of project
This Project Helps us Analyse and Visualize campaign outcomes based on dates and their funding goals. This project will be run using Microsoft Excel and built-in Analysis tools that will help us perform lengthy calculations in a shorter time. To make a better decision Some charts and tables might be filtered to simulate Louises's situation.

### Purpose
By The end of this project I want to help Louise make the best decistion possible on how much she should aim for to have a successful campaign and when she should start. I also want to explain how we got into our conclusions and the way we approached the data. Different Charts will be demonstrated through out the presentation to support the conclusion.

##  Analysis and Challenges
The first Analysis [Theater Outcome By launch Date](url) Was done to determine which month of the year was best to launch a campaign and specifically for a play. knowing there where a lot of categories and sub-categories we had to narrow it down to theater to increase the accuracy of our conclusion. We also Grouped the data by month and to furthur visualize the trends a `line with marker` chart was utilizied from excel. The next Challenge was to determine whether the Goal amount has any Corrolation with the success of a campaign.
